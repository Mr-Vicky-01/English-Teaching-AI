# English Teaching AI

English Teaching AI is an application that assists in translating Tamil or Tanglish queries into correct English sentences with proper grammar. It utilizes Google's GenerativeAI and Hugging Face's models to generate responses and even provides audio output for the translated sentences.

## How it Works

The application takes a Tamil or Tanglish query as input and generates a correct English sentence with proper grammar as output. It uses Google's GenerativeAI model to understand and respond to the queries. Additionally, it utilizes Hugging Face's text-to-speech model to provide audio output for the translated sentences.

The application is deployed using Hugging Face Spaces. You can access it [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Mr-Vicky-01/English-Teacher).
